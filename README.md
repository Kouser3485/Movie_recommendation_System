# Movie Recommendation System

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System! This Python script recommends movies based on user input using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and collaborative filtering.

## Introduction
This project implements a movie recommendation system that leverages NLP and collaborative filtering. The script processes a dataset containing movie titles, descriptions, genres, and content types to provide personalized movie suggestions.

## Features
- Data Cleaning: Converts text to lowercase, removes special characters, and eliminates stopwords.
- TF-IDF Vectorization: Transforms cleaned data into vectors for efficient comparison.
- Cosine Similarity: Recommends movies based on similarity scores using cosine similarity.
- User Interaction: Accepts user input for favorite movies and suggests similar movies.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the script:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- nltk

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python movie_recommendation.py
   ```

Follow the on-screen instructions to enter your favorite movie and receive recommendations.
